## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

I learn about customizing in Tailwind CSS. This is very useful since I could customize almost any features in Tailwind CSS.

For example, I could add a new font like **Montserrat** or **Fraunces**:

```js
fontFamily: {
  'montserrat': ['Montserrat', 'sans-serif'],
  'fraunces': ['Fraunces', 'serif'],
},
```
or add another color to use in this project:
```js
colors: {
  darkcyan: '#3c8067',
  cream: '#f2ebe3',
  verydarkblue: '#1c232b',
  darkgrayishblue: '#6c7289',
  active: '	#214538',
},
```
Even override the default style of Tailwind CSS:
```js
letterSpacing: {
  widest: '.25rem',
}
```

### Continued development

I should learn about responsive images, flex box, and breakpoints for future projects. It's really crucial when building a responsive website (or even a component).

### Useful resources
